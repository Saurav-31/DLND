    "# Language Translation\n",
    "In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation.  You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.\n",
    "## Get the Data\n",
    "Since translating the whole language of English to French will take lots of time to train, we have provided you with a small portion of the English corpus."
